# Static-Site-Generator

This is a static site generator, it takes Markdown and image files and converts them into readable html to serve in a static website. 

To serve your own content just add your markdown file in content folder(ideally a proper structured tree of folders plus index.md files).

## Requirements:

- Python 3 or above

## Instructions:

1. Make sure the main.sh has execution rights with command:
```bash
chmod +x main.sh
```

2. Run the script with:
```bash
./main.sh
```
  This will start the project main.py file and serve on port 8888.

## Testing:

1. Same as main script, make sure test.sh has execution rights with command:
```bash
chmod +x test.sh
```

2. Run all unit tests with command:

```bash
./test.sh
```
